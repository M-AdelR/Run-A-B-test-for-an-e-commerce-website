## Project Description
The hypothesis test part was about Do you stop as soon as one page is considered significantly better than another or does it need to happen consistently for a certain amount of time?How long do you run to render a decision that neither page is better than another?  As analysis has been proved that the alternative is one right-tailed test. Scientific studies value means P_value, as shown above, P_value value is greater than 0.05 which means high probability, so there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis, where the value is equal to obbs_diff or less. Aslo running Z-test, and found The value of the z-score tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean. As shown above, the null hypothesis is std above the mean, so, the p-value also is not below 0.05. which means the p-value is like the calculated p-value finally, the z-test proves to agree with the previous calculations.
